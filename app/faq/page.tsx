      questions: [
        {
          q: "Who qualifies for assistance?",
          a: "We serve individuals and families facing health challenges and mobility needs when insurance coverage falls short. Eligibility is based on medical necessity, financial need, and available funding. We do not require extensive documentation or PHI for most programs.",
        },
        {
          q: "How do I apply for assistance?",
          a: "Applications can be submitted through our contact form or by calling us directly at +1-770-568-0063. The application process is simple and requires only basic information about your need and situation. No complex paperwork or medical records are required for initial applications.",
        },
        {
          q: "How long does the approval process take?",
          a: "Most applications are reviewed within 48 hours. Urgent needs are often approved same-week. We understand that medical needs can't wait, so we prioritize fast turnaround times while maintaining thorough review standards.",
        },
        {
          q: "Is this a loan or a gift?",
          a: "All assistance provided through Good Neighbor Fund is a gift, not a loan. There is no repayment required. We believe that those facing health challenges shouldn't have additional financial burdens.",
        },

    {
      category: "Financial Questions",
      questions: [
        {

        },
        {
          q: "How are funds distributed?",
          a: "We use a direct-to-vendor payment model. This means we pay suppliers, contractors, and medical vendors directlyâ€”never giving cash to applicants. This ensures transparency, reduces risk, and maximizes the impact of every donation.",
        },
        {
          q: "Are donations tax-deductible?",
          a: "Yes. Good Neighbor Health & Mobility Project is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. All donations are tax-deductible to the full extent allowed by law. We provide donation receipts for your tax records.",
        },
        {
          q: "Can I designate my donation to a specific program?",
          a: "Yes. When donating, you can choose to support a specific program (Holiday Stockings, DME Micro-Grants, Tube Feeding, or Wheelchair Ramps) or allow us to direct funds where they're needed most.",

        {
          q: "What information do you collect?",
          a: "We collect only the minimum information necessary to process your application and provide assistance. This typically includes contact information, a description of your need, and basic financial situation. No Protected Health Information (PHI) is required for most programs.",
        },
        {
          q: "How do you protect my data?",
          a: "We use secure systems for data storage and transmission. Access to personal information is limited to authorized staff only. We follow industry best practices for data security and privacy protection.",
