        subtitle: Getting to Medical Appointments
        text: >
          Many patients struggle to get to critical medical appointments due to mobility
          challenges or lack of accessible transportation. We're developing a program to
          provide rides to medical appointments, ensuring patients don't miss vital care.


          **Planned Features:**

          • Accessible vehicle partnerships

          • Volunteer driver network

          • Coordination with healthcare providers

          • Same-day and scheduled rides

          • Coverage across Georgia regions

          While wheelchair ramps are essential, many patients need additional home
          modifications for safety and independence. This program will fund grab bars,
          shower seats, improved lighting, and other safety features.


          **Planned Features:**

          • Grab bars for bathrooms and hallways

          • Shower seats and transfer benches

          • Improved lighting for fall prevention

          • Door widening for wheelchair access

          • Non-slip flooring installations

        subtitle: Supporting Medical Equipment Costs
        text: >
          Medical equipment like oxygen concentrators, hospital beds, and tube-feeding
          pumps can significantly increase electricity costs. This program will help
          offset those utility expenses for families already facing financial strain.


          **Planned Features:**

          • Direct payments to utility companies

          • Monthly or quarterly assistance

          • Coordination with medical equipment suppliers

          • Documentation of equipment electricity needs

          • Emergency assistance for shutoff prevention

        subtitle: Supporting Those Who Care
        text: >
          Family caregivers need breaks to prevent burnout and maintain their own health.
          We're exploring ways to provide temporary care services, giving caregivers the
          respite they desperately need.


          **Vision:**

          • Professional respite care services

          • Volunteer companion programs

          • Coordination with home health agencies

          • Flexible scheduling

          • Both short-term and recurring support

          Telemedicine is increasingly important, but not everyone has the technology
          needed to access virtual healthcare. This program would provide tablets and
          internet connectivity for telehealth appointments.


          **Vision:**

          • Tablet distribution with medical apps

          • Internet connectivity assistance

          • Training on telehealth technology

          • Technical support services

        subtitle: Short-Term Equipment Loans
        text: >
          Sometimes patients need equipment temporarily - during recovery or while
          waiting for insurance approval. A lending library would provide short-term
          access to medical equipment at no cost.


          **Vision:**

          • Inventory of common medical equipment

          • Clean, sanitized, quality-checked items

          • Short-term loan agreements

          • Delivery and pickup services

          • Equipment maintenance and storage
