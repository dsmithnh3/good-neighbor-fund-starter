  # Direct Vendor Payment Model

    subtitle: Maximizing Impact, Ensuring Transparency
    text: >
      **Why We Pay Vendors Directly**


      We never give cash directly to applicants. Instead, we pay suppliers, equipment vendors,
      formula manufacturers, and contractors directly. This approach:


      • **Builds donor confidence** - You know exactly where your money goes


      • **Reduces risk** - Ensures funds are used for their intended purpose


      • **Maximizes impact** - Every dollar goes directly to the need


      • **Maintains dignity** - Recipients aren't burdened with financial transactions


      **How It Works:**


      When someone needs a wheelchair ramp, we work with licensed contractors and pay them directly.
      For tube-feeding formula, we coordinate with suppliers and handle payment. For DME micro-grants,
      we work with equipment vendors to ensure proper selection and direct payment.

      **When Coverage Falls Short, We're Here**


      Insurance companies and government programs don't always cover everything patients need.
      We fill critical gaps:


      • **Waiting periods** - Insurance delays while patients suffer. We provide rapid response.


      • **Coverage denials** - Equipment deemed "not medically necessary" but essential for safety.


      • **Out-of-pocket costs** - Copays and deductibles families can't afford.


      • **Formula limits** - Insufficient monthly allowances for tube-feeding patients.


      • **Home modifications** - Rarely covered by any program, yet critical for independence.


      • **"Between the cracks"** - People who don't qualify for government programs but can't afford
      equipment on their own.


      **When coverage falls short, we're here.** That's our promise to Georgia residents.
