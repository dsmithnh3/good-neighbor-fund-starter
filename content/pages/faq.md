          Georgia residents with medical needs not adequately covered by insurance or government

        title: Is this a loan or a gift?
        text: >
          All assistance from Good Neighbor Mobility Fund is provided as a gift - not a loan.
          There is no expectation of repayment. We believe in helping neighbors without creating
          additional financial burden.

      - title: How are funds distributed?
        text: >
          We use a direct-to-vendor payment model. This means we pay suppliers, equipment vendors,
          and contractors directly - never giving cash to applicants. This ensures transparency,
          maximizes impact, and builds donor trust.

          ranging from $100-$500. They cover critical equipment like rollators with seats,
          heel-protective boots, fall-alert devices, and other items often denied by insurance.
