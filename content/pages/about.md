    subtitle: How we began serving Georgia communities
    text: >
      Good Neighbor Mobility Fund was founded in response to the growing need for 
      practical support when insurance coverage falls short. We recognized that 
      many Georgia residents were struggling to access essential medical equipment, 
      home modifications, and nutritional support that could make the difference 
      between independence and institutionalization.
